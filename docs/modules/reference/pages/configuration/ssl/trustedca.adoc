= Trusted CA Signing
Generate a certificate signing request (or CSR) from the key that you created above.
The command to do this is straightforward.
The filename you specify for the file parameter will contain the CSR after the command completes.

[source, console]
----
keytool -certreq -keystore /tmp/propercert/proper.keystore -file /tmp/propercert/proper.csr -alias opennms-jetty
Enter keystore password:  aGoodStrongKeystorePassword
Enter key password for <mykey>anotherGoodStrongPassword
----

The CSR output file is a text file whose contents will look similar to the following:

[source, certificate]
----
-----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

-----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

There is no particular need to protect the CSR, as it contains no data that would aid an attacker.

== Submit the CSR to the trusted CA
Send the certificate signing request (CSR) that you just generated to a certificate authority (CA) that you trust.
This could be a commercial CA whose signatures most or all modern browsers will honor (for discussion, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) or a CA that is internal to your organization and whose public key is installed into all browsers on your organization's computers.
The specifics of this step are entirely outside the scope of this article.

== Import the signed certificate
After you submit the certificate signing request to the CA, and fulfill the CA's requirements for validating your identity and trustworthiness, the CA will send you a certificate file that bears the CA's signature.

The signed certificate consists of the public half of the key that you generated in the first step plus a signature performed using the CA's private key.
Therefore, the signed certificate (like the CSR)  contains no information that will aid an attacker if it is disclosed.

In order for your OpenNMS server to use the signed certificate, you must replace the self-signed certificate created in the first step by the signed certificate.
You do that by importing the signed certificate for the same alias that you defined in the first step (here "opennms-jetty"):

[source, console]
----
keytool -import -keystore /tmp/propercert/proper.keystore -file /path/to/signed-cert.txt -alias opennms-jetty
Enter keystore password:  aGoodStrongKeystorePassword
----

NOTE: This requires that your keystore already trust the CA that has signed your certificate.
If you see the error "keytool error: java.lang.Exception: Public keys in reply and keystore don't match", this indicates that you need to import your certificate authority's CA certificate first:

[source, console]
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias <my-CA-root> -keystore /tmp/propercert/proper.keystore -file /path/to/CA-cert.txt
Enter keystore password:  aGoodStrongKeystorePassword
----

Now retry the import of the server cert.
