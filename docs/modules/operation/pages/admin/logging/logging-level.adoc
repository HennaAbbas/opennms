| Description

| INFO
| Anything likely to be useful to the average user to determine the current general behavior/state of the system.

| WARNING
| Messages relating to code that has a failure that might be temporary or recoverable, or code that is misconfigured but can continue running in a regressed state.

| ERROR
| Only things that cause code to stop working and be unrecoverable.

| DEBUG
| Additional information that can help diagnose issues.

| TRACE
| Even more additional information that is often useful only to developers, or is very high output and thus could cause performance issues when enabled.
