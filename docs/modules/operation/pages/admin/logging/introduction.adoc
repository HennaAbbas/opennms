= Logging

{page-component-title} stores logs into different files in the filesystem depending and named on the daemon that was acting on a process.

For example: Logs for xref:operation:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ga-service-assurance[service assurance checks] that are done by `pollerd` are stored in a file called `pollerd.log`.

The log files can be found in `/var/log/opennms/`.

== Change logging behavior

[[ga-logging-change-behavior]]

{page-component-title} uses the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/[Apache Log4j] framework for managing how the logs are being written, structured or rotated.

The configuration file can be found in `/etc/opennms/log4j2.xml`.

Each daemon can have an individual logging level.

The corresponding configuration in this file can be found in the XML tree path

*configuration/loggers/root/DynamicThresholdFilter/KeyValuePair*

The default logging level is `WARN`.
But the levels can be set to `TRACE`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` depending on the need.

For troubleshooting purposes `DEBUG` can be used. 
By saving the changes in this file {page-component-title} needs a few seconds to apply the changes.
The additional `DEBUG` log output is now also being written to the corresponding log file.

NOTE: Don't forget to set the logging level back to `WARN` after changing it to an higher severity.
Depending on the scale {page-component-title} can generate a lot more logs which will require more disk space.
