= External Authentication

If you have an existing directory for authenticating users, {page-component-title} can be configured to utilize that system for granting users access to login, in addition to allowing login from users defined directly within your {page-component-title} server.

== Configuring external authentication

The {page-component-title} webapp uses link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security] for its user authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) concerns.
Configuring external authentication requires configuring Spring Security correctly for your own environment.

The Spring Security configuration can be modified without making large, invasive changes to the main context file.
Here is a summary of the files involved:

[source, directory]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/
|-- opennms
|   |-- WEB-INF
|   |   |-- applicationContext-spring-security.xml
|   |   |-- spring-security.d
|   |   |   |-- activeDirectory.xml.disabled
|   |   |   |-- ldap.xml.disabled
|   |   |   |-- radius.xml.disabled
----

There may be additional example files in your installation.

applicationContext-spring-security.xml::
The main Spring Security context configuration file for the OpenNMS webapp.
The `authentication-provider` setting must be uncommented to switch on external authentication.

[source, xml]
----
    <!-- To enable external (e.g. LDAP, RADIUS) authentication, uncomment the following.
         You must also rename and customize exactly ONE of the example files in the
         spring-security.d subdirectory.-->
    <authentication-provider ref="externalAuthenticationProvider" />
----

spring-security.d::
Directory containing example files for common use cases.
You must copy one of these files to a name of your own choosing, as long as it ends in `.xml`, and edit its details as outlined below.
There cannot be more than one non-disabled xml file in this directory.

*.xml.disabled::
Skeleton files to use as a starter for your configuration.
The "disabled" files are ignored when Spring Security loads.

== Anatomy of an LDAP configuration

Whether the authentication source is an Active Directory, a Novell eDirectory, or some other LDAP-enabled directory, the basic components (expressed as "beans" in Spring Framework lingo) that need to exist and be configured are the same.

While Active Directory and OpenLDAP (and others) implement the same LDAP protocol, their schemas are substantially different.
The biggest difference is the `memberOf` attribute, which is not supported by default LDAP v3 specification, and is not present in common OpenLDAP installs, but comes standard with AD.
This has a significant implication in that you cannot filter a user search by nested group membership, and most installs tend not to be fully hierarchical (User's DN doesn't cite a home group).
You can either create dedicated per-role LDAP groups or map existing groups to roles by selecting and configuring the appropriate `userGroupLdapAuthoritiesPopulator`.

contextSource::
Define your LDAP server URL(s) and search base.
If you have multiple LDAP servers, include them as separate `<beans:value>` entries.

authenticationSource::
Provide credentials to bind to your directory in the `defaultUser` and `defaultPassword` properties.

userSearch::
Tells Spring Security where to find the users in your directory.

userGroupLdapAuthoritiesPopulator::
Tells Spring Security where to find groups in your directory.
By defining `groupToRoleMap` entries, groups in your directory can be mapped to one or more security roles to determine what level of access the user should be granted.

NOTE: If your directory requires a SSL connection, and is signed with a private certificate authority, make sure to add the certificates to your xref:admin/https/https-client.adoc[truststore].

After making any changes to Spring Security configuration, {page-component-title} must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
Before doing this, it's a good idea to check that your changes have not led to malformed XML files:

[source, console]
----
xmllint --noout applicationContext-spring-security.xml spring-security.d/*.xml
----

If this command produces no output, then the XML files are well-formed.
If you've gotten all the details right, you'll be able to log in to the webapp with your directory credentials after restarting OpenNMS.


== Troubleshooting

If your server is not allowing login via your configured external authentication provider, authentication logs are written to `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/logs/web.log`.
